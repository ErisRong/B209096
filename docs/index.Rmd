# Total research goal: "The Impact of COVID-19 on Maternal Healthcare: Trends in Access to Care, Pregnancy outcomes, and Termination numbers."
```

```{r}
# The COVID-19 pandemic introduced unique challenges to healthcare systems globally, significantly impacting both routine and emergency medical services. Maternity care, which is essential and time-sensitive for both maternal and neonatal health, encountered substantial risks due to these disruptions. The goal is to extract lessons that can safeguard maternity services during future emergencies. Emphasizing this issue is crucial, as it highlights both the resilience and vulnerabilities of healthcare delivery under stress, providing important insights for ensuring equitable and effective care for pregnant individuals. Furthermore, understanding these trends can inform the development of policies aimed at mitigating the effects of similar crises on maternal and child health outcomes worldwide.
